                <h3> What I like about my school library is that everyone who is in there or near has to be very queit. It is very peaceful when you read there. The fun things happen in books which to me are like sometimes my best friends especially the characters in the book. Not like in people. They don't go through adventures like slaying a Drakon that only a chil of Ares can slay, wait sorry i'm getting of track. But, anyway I don't people because they don't go through much adventures. But yeah books are pretty much the best. </h3> <br><br>
